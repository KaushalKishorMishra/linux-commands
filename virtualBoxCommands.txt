The commands you shared:

```bash
sudo rmmod kvm_intel
sudo rmmod kvm
```

are used to **remove** (unload) the kernel modules `kvm_intel` and `kvm`.

To reverse this — i.e., to **load** those kernel modules back — you use:

```bash
sudo modprobe kvm
sudo modprobe kvm_intel
```

### Explanation:

* `rmmod` removes a module.
* `modprobe` inserts (loads) a module, resolving dependencies automatically.

In your case, `kvm_intel` depends on `kvm`, so usually you load `kvm` first, then `kvm_intel`.

If you want to check whether the modules are loaded or not, use:

```bash
lsmod | grep kvm
```

Would you like help with any related commands or to verify if the modules are active?
